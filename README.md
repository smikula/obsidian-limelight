## Installation

> This plugin is brand new and hasn't been accepted as a community plugin yet.  If you want to try it out, you can install it manually with the below steps (based on [this guide](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/plugins-mini-faq/7737)).  Once it is a community plugin this section will be updated with the normal installation steps.

1. Find the latest release on [this page](https://github.com/smikula/obsidian-limelight/releases).
2. Download `obsidian-limelight.zip` from that release.
3. In your vault, extract that zip file into `.obsidian/plugins/`.  (You may need to create the `plugins` directory if this is your first plugin.)
4. In Obsidian, go to Settings > Community plugins and enable "Limelight".  (You may need to disable safe mode first.)
